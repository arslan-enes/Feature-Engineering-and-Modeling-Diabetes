# Feature-Engineering-and-Modeling-Diabetes

### Business Problem

Can we build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

### Dataset

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
